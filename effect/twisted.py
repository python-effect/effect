"""
Twisted integration for the Effect library.

This is largely concerned with bridging the gap between Effects and Deferreds,
and also implementing Twisted-specific performers for standard Intents.

The most important functions here are :func:`perform`,
:func:`make_twisted_dispatcher`, and :func:`deferred_performer`.

Note that the core effect library does *not* depend on Twisted, but this module
does.

"""
Standard intents and some of their performers.

The :obj:`base_dispatcher` object in this module is a dispatcher which provides
standard performers for intents which really only have one reasonable way to be
performed, sunch as :class:`Func`, :class:`Error`, and
:class:`Constant`.

Other intents, such as :class:`ParallelEffects` and :class:`Delay`, need to
have a performer specified elsewhere, since the performers are reliant on
choices made by the application author. :module:`effect.twisted` provides a
Twisted-specific dispatcher for these.

    - it's harder to test, since the only thing you can do is call the

    - it doesn't offer any ability for changing the way the effect is
      performed.

    If you use Func in your application code, know that you are giving
    up some ease of testing and flexibility. It's preferable to represent your
    intents as inert objects with public attributes of simple data. However,

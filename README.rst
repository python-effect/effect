Effect is a library for helping you write purely functional code by
isolating the effects (that is, IO or state manipulation) in your code.
Documentation is available at https://effect.readthedocs.org/.

Status: Alpha
=============

Right now Effect is in alpha, and is likely to change incompatibly. Once it's
being used in production and the API seems pretty good, a final version will be
released. Because it's in alpha, ``pip`` requires that you explicitly specify
the version number when specifying a dependency. This means that you won't
automatically get upgraded to newer versions that potentially break the API.
e.g., use `pip install effect==0.1aN`.


What Is It?
===========

Effect lets you isolate your IO and state-manipulation code, by using a system
very similar to Haskell's `extensible-effects`_ package. It also has
similarities to Twisted's Deferred objects.

.. _`extensible-effects`: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extensible-effects

The benefits of this are many: first, the majority of your code can become
purely functional, leading to easier testing and ability to reason about
behavior. Also, because it separates the specification of an effect from the
performance of the effect, there are two more benefits: testing becomes easier
still, and it's easy to provide alternative implementations of effects.


Example
=======

A very quick example of using Effects:

.. code:: python

    from __future__ import print_function
    from effect import perform, sync_performer, Effect, TypeDispatcher

    class ReadLine(object):
	def __init__(self, prompt):
	    self.prompt = prompt

    def get_user_name():
	return Effect(ReadLine("Enter a candy> "))

    @sync_performer
    def perform_read_line(dispatcher, readline):
	return raw_input(readline.prompt)

    def main():
	effect = get_user_name()
	effect = effect.on(
	    success=lambda result: print("I like {} too!".format(result)),
	    error=lambda e: print("sorry, there was an error. {}".format(e)))

	dispatcher = TypeDispatcher({ReadLine: perform_read_line})
	perform(dispatcher, effect)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()


``Effect`` takes what we call an ``intent``, which is any object. The
``dispatcher`` argument to ``perform`` must have a ``performer`` function
for your intent.

This has a number of advantages. First, your unit tests for ``get_user_name``
become simpler. You don't need to mock out or parameterize the ``raw_input``
function - you just call ``get_user_name`` and assert that it returns a ReadLine
object with the correct 'prompt' value.

Second, you can implement ReadLine in a number of different ways - it's
possible to override the way an intent is performed to do whatever you want.

For more information on how to implement the actual effect-performing code,
and other details, see the `documentation`_. There is also a full example
of interacting with the user and using an HTTP client to talk to the GitHub
API in the `examples`_ directory.

Over the past few years, the ecosystem of libraries to help with functional
programming in Python has exploded. Here are some libraries I recommend:

- `pyrsistent`_ - persistent (optimized immutable) data structures in Python
- `toolz`_ - a general library of pure FP functions
- `fn.py`_ - a Scala-inspired set of tools, including a weird lambda syntax, option type, and monads

.. _`pyrsistent`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrsistent/
